              An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the
              viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if
              the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom and left properties
              are used to position the element.

              An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the
              nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the
              vieuwport, like fixed).

            <td>
              However; if an absolute positioned has no positioned ancestors, it
              uses the document body and moves along with page scrolling.

              user;s scroll position.
            </td>
            <td colspan="2">
              A sticky element toggles beween relative and fixed, depending on
              the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given
              offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place
              (like position: fixed).

            Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element
            itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height
            and width values.
